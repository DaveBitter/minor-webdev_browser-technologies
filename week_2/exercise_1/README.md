# Feature Detection
## HTML
### Text-input fallback 
If you lookup the color input type on [caniuse.com](http://caniuse.com/#feat=input-color) you can see that it isn't supported on IE11. The input type will fallback to text in order to still provide a way for users to input the color. A hint to the syntax is displayed in the placeholder. Placeholders in inputs are also not supported on some browser, [like IE11](http://caniuse.com/#feat=css-placeholder-shown). The text for the placeholder is displayed in the label in order to still display the information. Optionally, you can remove this text when the browser does support placholders.
