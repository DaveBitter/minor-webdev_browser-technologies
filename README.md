This repository holds the seperate exercises for the course 'Browser Technolgies', part of the minor "Webdevelopment" at the [HvA](http://www.hva.nl/)

All exercise folders are standalone projects and work as such. You can navigate through the folder structure or through the navigation below.

## Issues
I highly encourage adding issues to this repo in the case of finding one. I'm always up for improving my code.
