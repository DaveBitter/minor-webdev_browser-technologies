### Conclusion
A lot of website work okay without images. The broken stuff is mostly due to positioning and sizing. On my portfolio website I also ran into the issue of text being unreadable because the text is white on a white background.
On Pinterest buttons use images as icons. These buttons don't provide any alternative feedback to the user abouut the action. On the other hand, Pinterest handles not loading the images the best. A random colored background shows when an image isn't loaded. On some images the link to the image is added in the alt. This is a good way of provinding the link to the image to open when images can be loaded.
It's good to look at a way to not break the rest of the interface when an image isn't loaded. It's fairly easy to do by setting min-widths and min-heights.
